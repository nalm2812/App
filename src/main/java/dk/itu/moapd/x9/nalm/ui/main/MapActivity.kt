     * `managedQuery(android.net.Uri, String[], String, String[], String)` to retrieve cursors for
     * data being displayed, etc.
     *
     * You can call `finish()` from within this function, in which case `onDestroy()` will be
     * immediately called after `onCreate()` without any of the rest of the activity lifecycle
     * (`onStart()`, `onResume()`, onPause()`, etc) executing.

     * they do not, an exception will be thrown.</em>

     * down then this Bundle contains the data it most recently supplied in `onSaveInstanceState()`.
